          <p>I am a Seattle-based full-stack rails developer who recently switched careers.<p>

          <p>I love learning and I learn very quickly. Two years ago I didnâ€™t even know what Ruby on Rails was and had not written a line of code since programming my TI-86 to do the quadratic formula for me in high school. I taught myself Ruby using nothing but library books and google and then I got in to Code Fellows where I learned how to write and deploy a functioning Rails app (among other things) in two months.</p>

          <p>I am self-motivated but also work well with others. I have experience working in an Agile environment and am well-versed in using Git for version control and collaboration.</p>

          <p>I am currently looking for a full-time Ruby on Rails developer job in the Seattle area. You can see my code on my github: github.com/kaxla and live versions of my projects below in the "Projects" section.</p>
